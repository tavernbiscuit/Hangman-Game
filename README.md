A simple Python console application I developed as part of my journey to learn Python. Additionally, I wrote a Dockerfile for this application and deployed it as a container running inside of Gotty, a terminal emulator. Using a self-hosted container instance of SWAG, I set up a reverse proxy to make this application accessible via my domain at hangman.langeitsolutions.com
